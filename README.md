# Capstone Project-3
Predicting Car Prices using Machine Learning Techniques and Streamlit Application

Project Summary: This project entails a thorough process of data cleansing, integrating, and analysis, including customer, sales, exchange rate, products, and store data. The workflow is meticulously described in the following step-by-step guide:
Step 1: Collection of data files (CSV) and prepare to analyse using Python Programme 
Step 2: Using Pandas to read the CSV data files (Customers, Sales, Products, Stores, and Exchange rate) 
Step 3: Cleaning data files including identification and handling of missing values, conversion of data types (e.g., Date, integers, floats, string)
Step 4: Merging all cleaned data into a single data frame using Pandas merging function with inner join method for analysis
Step 5: Establishing connection between VS code environment and PostgreSQL. Creating data tables (Sales, Products, Customers, Exchange rate, and Stores) and query in PostgreSQL to get analysis 
Step 6: Establish connection between PostgreSQL and Power BI to extract and visualize key insights from overall and each table data.
